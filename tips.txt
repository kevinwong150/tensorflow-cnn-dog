# python 3 problem
the grammar of python2 and python3 is similiar to each other. You can write your code in python 3 first, then submit it. The submission system will give you feed back if there is any grammar mistake in your code. After modification, you can submit again. There is no penalty for re-submit before deadline.

# neagetive value in validation.npy
Reason: to reduce the size of validation.npy, I used dtype as unit8, instead of int32 when saving the file. The value will be negative when you read it as int32, if the original value is bigger than 128.
Solution: convert it to uint8, for example:

tmp = np.load("validation").item()
a = tmp["reshaped"][0].astype(np.unit8)

# there are some typos in the specification, I have corrected them with blue color text.
